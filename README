                        PHP Tutor Scheduler

INTRODUCTION

This is a very basic scheduling system for an online tutoring website. It is
designed to integrate with Groupworld (http://www.groupworld.net), both
hosted and enterprise versions, but could easily be modified to support
other online tutoring systems.

INSTALLATION

[1] Edit config.php and db.php to your requirements.
[2] Create the database:

mysql -u root < tutor_scheduler.sql
mysql_setpermission -u root
(add a user "groupworld" to database "tutor_scheduler" with extended user 
privileges)

[3] Create an admin user:
mysql -u groupworld
use tutor_scheduler
insert into user values(null, 'admin', 'A', now(), 'admin@test.com', 'password', 'admin', 'user', '', '', '', '', '', '', 101);

(replace 'password' with the admin password you want to use)

[4] Log on as admin:

https://yourserver.com/tutor_scheduler/

USING THE SYSTEM

[1] Create students and teachers in the admin control panel.
[2] Create sessions for those users in the admin control panel.
[3] Teacher and students log in at the appointed time and are directed
to their Groupworld conference room.
[4] After the session has ended, users are automatically logged off. The start
time is determined by the time that both users have logged in, and the end
time is the start time + the scheduled session length.
[5] Users' login and logout times are stored in the session list.

Admin users can log into any session.

CUSTOMIZATION

See http://www.groupworld.net/api.shtml

API parameters can be added to room.php, just before the groupworld.htmlgen 
call.

By default each session is allocated its own Groupworld room, with its own
storage space and whiteboard state. To make it so that the whiteboard is
not persistent (i.e. that the contents are deleted when all users log off),
just set the persistent_whiteboards Groupworld server option to false
(/usr/local/groupworld/data/options in the enterprise license, or the
"server configuration" page in the hosted control panel).
